# JsonWrapper
Some Json utilities to prevent repetitive code in Unreal Engine

## About

Very simple plugin wrapping built-in Json functionnalities in Unreal. Those being very verbose, the idea was to create wrapping functions to prevent too much repetitive code.

> [!NOTE]  
> These functions were tailored for my specific use. I just thought of sharing them with others as they save me some time.

> [!WARNING]  
> Supported Unreal versions: 5.4. (Did not try with older versions.)

### Functions

- Serialize Json (from Json object to string)
- Deserialize Json (from string to Json object)
- Write Json object to file
- Load Json object from file
